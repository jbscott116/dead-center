# Dead-Center.js
Adds class-based tool to center HTML elements vertically within their parent containers.

**NOTE: I wouldn't recommend that anyone use this in production work yet. I've got more testing to do.**

## Installation
Clone the project from GitHub.  
`git clone "https://github.com/jbscott116/writer.git"`  

Add the script at the end of your `<body>` element.  
`<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/dead-center.js"></script>`  

Add the `dcv` or `dc-v` classes to any elements that you want center vertically.  
`<h1 class="dcv">Hello, World!</h1>`
